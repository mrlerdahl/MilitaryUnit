# MilitaryUnit
Class Exercise

## Description
This project was used to show our understanding of inheritance. I basically just wrote a short story of four military personnel each personnel is their own object. From their I set their vehicle and the specific vehicle they are given is derived from the base class Vehicle. Same goes with their weapon of choice. As the story goes on the CAPT tells the Marines to fire their weapon which is a method called from the personnel class and that method calls the firing noise of the weapon from the weapon derived class. Then the CAPT proceeds to tell them to reload, mount their vehicle, and drive off.
